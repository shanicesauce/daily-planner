#  Work Day Scheduler

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## What was done

Utilized bootstrap, jQuery and Moment to ensure the planner displays a 9am-5pm time. Allowing the user to set a to do plan during a specific time and save it to local storage that will load the saved plan when the user interacts with the site.
